 PVPGN UPDATE INFORMATION
==========================

This file contains a summary of all changes from previous version you need to 
take care of when updating your server to the current version.
It should contain:
-- info's about all new/changed parameters in bnetd.conf
-- all new/changed config files in the conf/ subfolder
The path's specified are those of the default unix installation

 Updating from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1
==============================

Configuration files changed:
- conf/bnetd.conf : added "max_connections" parameter to set up the max 
    allowed number of connections to the bnetd daemon
- conf/d2cs.conf : added "max_connections" parameter to set up the max 
    allowed number of connections to the d2cs daemon
- conf/d2dbs.conf : added "difficulty_hack" parameter to activate the
    Diablo II level 100 workaround

 Updating from 1.6.x to 1.7.0
==============================

Because of the many changes in 1.7.0 we recommend to use a clean install 
and update the configuration files as necesarry. Things to note:
1. you now need GNU make to build PvPGN on POSIX systems (on Linux this is 
just "make" but on *BSD is "gmake")
2. d2trans,gametrans,w3trans have been unified under address_translation.conf 
file which has a complete new syntax so take care with that
