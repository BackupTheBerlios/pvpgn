PvPGN Version History:

1.2.0 ???:
-- fixed disconnet = loss bug for PG and AT

be easily parsed to create nice ladder pages for the web (output interval can
be configured via bnetd.conf)

DB now

-- added option to reduce the size of accounts by not keeping firstlogin infos

a new parameter in bnetd.conf and the new command /remove_accounting_infos
