PvPGN Version History:

1.2.4
-- irc: prevented "unknown command"-flooding by adding ignors for lagtime and ISON
-- irc: changed motd from old huge bnetd logo to smaller message
-- bnetd-commnds can be typed as in battle.net without need for the /BNET in 
front of it anymore
-- passing all unkown commands from irc to bnet-command-interpreter now
-- winmain.c : new handler for admin-console, fixed/optimized some main code, 
removed last compiler warnings from win32-release
-- fixed a tiny bug in anongame.c causing the recently added timer not to close 
a players game-connection but his connection to the server
-- fixed some error in war3ladder causing ladder not to be updated
-- better handling of "broken" atteams in war3ladder
-- new bnetd.conf options:
 - added boolean option XML_output_ladder for supporting jfro's latest ladder
-- added command line option -x and --XML to run bntrackd in XML output mode
and added a nice servers.xsl from jfro to show server list based on XML files

1.2.3:
-- fixed some crash related bugs
-- rewritten handle_bnet.c from 5000 lines case/switch style to a table of
function handlers (should be more readable)

-- output of War3 ladder into 4 seperate text files in /var/ladders that can
be easily parsed to create nice ladder pages for the web (output interval can
be configured via bnetd.conf)
-- some optimizations for MySQL mode - only changed attributes are flushed to
DB now
-- fixed 3 tiny memory leaks (files not beeing closed after opening them)
-- added option to reduce the size of accounts by not keeping firstlogin infos
in the account and removing unused lastlogin infos (experimental - if your
client seems to miss some info now, plz report as a bug). This can be done via
a new parameter in bnetd.conf and the new command /remove_accounting_infos
