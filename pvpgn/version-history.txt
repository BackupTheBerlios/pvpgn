PvPGN Version History:

1.7.0 since 1.6.2

[D2CS]
  -- made ordering of chars on char-selection screen configurable
  -- fixed "d2cs not trying to reconnect" issue
  -- made sure maxchar limit for an account is enforced
  -- added WIN32 GUI feature

[D2DBS]
  -- fixed "deleted a ladder char and created one with the same name
     breaks the ladder" problem. If your ladder is broken, delete it.
     If your players want their chars to stay in ladder they shouldn't
     delete them cause new chars with same name will remove the old entry
  -- added WIN32 GUI feature

[STAR/SEXP/W2BN]:
  -- changed handling of gameresults to be democratic
  -- fixed problem with win/games ladder

[STAR/SEXP] : fixed "v1.11 can't play ladder games"-problem

[IRC]: major cleanup of handle_irc.c
  -- hiding IP on channel join/leave to non admins when hide_addr=true
  -- now on IRC channel topics are supported (at least their output)
  -- PvPGN can only handle being in one channel at once, so the server
  now makes sure you leave the channel you were previously in.
  -- added /NOTICE, /ISON and /WHOIS handling
  -- now the real MOTD displays when connecting via IRC
  -- allow changing /nick before login
  -- allow another try on a wrong /msg nickserv identify <pass>
  -- added passfail count to IRC connections to prevent bruteforce logins

[D2]
  -- added the option to supply norm, night, hell to /games d2xp command
  for finding a game of a specific difficulty.

[WAR3]: 
  -- droped <1.13 support, added 1.15 support (CG,PG,AT, clan profile view)
  -- added code to detect the right w3routeip if is set to 0.0.0.0
  -- redone major parts of the AT code (old AT teams will be lost)

[LADDERS]:
  -- added .dat/.xml ladder output for STAR/SEXP/W2BN rating based ladder
  -- moved textual ladder files from ladderdir to statusdir

[PREFS]
  -- fixed handling of comments (previously it skipped the whole line no 
  matter where '#' was)

[FDWATCH]
  -- removed useless template usage because events field is r/o for pollfd
  structs

[MISC]:
  -- updated autoupdate with latest clients versions
  -- fixed "message_cache_lookup: unsupported connection class" errors when 
  broadcasting message (ex /ann) and having any connection different than 
  irc/telnet/bot/bnet (ex d2cs etc)
  -- added client, version and country info to the /finger command
  -- added clan and clan rank info to the /finger command
  -- added option to bnmotd.txt to display info about new mail
  -- adjusted /whois command to be more like on battle.net
  -- massivly renamed configuration files so each has an extension
  -- added scripts/pvpgn_hash.inc.php so everyone who needs has a php-
     implementation of the commonly used passhash algorithm
  -- fixed problem with topaz-chat (and maybe other clients, too)
     not propperly displaying tmpOP on initial channel join
  -- adjusted friends/watch game/server join/leave message to be more like b.net
     (changed message type from info to whisper)
  -- fixed channel behaviour to now really allow a common channel for all clients
     (different shortname, same special name)
  -- changed all 4 bytes tags (clienttags, archtags, etc) to use internally 
     integers for comparations instead of strings
  -- changed almost every place where sending username to send the logged in 
  username (if differs in case) than the account username (this fixes some bugs 
  like modifying some account data when logged in with different case and also 
  gets us to closer Battle.net behaivour)
  -- added /moderate command to moderate/unmoderate a channel
