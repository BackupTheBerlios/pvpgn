PvPGN Version History:

1.7.0 since 1.6.2

[D2CS]
  -- made ordering of chars on char-selection screen configurable
  -- fixed "d2cs not trying to reconnect" issue

[STAR/SEXP/W2BN]:
  -- changed handling of gameresults to be democratic
  -- fixed problem with win/games ladder

[STAR/SEXP] : fixed "v1.11 can't play ladder games"-problem

[IRC]: major cleanup of handle_irc.c
  -- hiding IP on channel join/leave to non admins when hide_addr=true
  -- now on IRC channel topics are supported (at least their output)
  -- PvPGN can only handle being in one channel at once, so the server
  now makes sure you leave the channel you were previously in.
  -- added /NOTICE, /ISON and /WHOIS handling
  -- now the real MOTD displays when connecting via IRC
  -- allow changing /nick before login
  -- allow another try on a wrong /msg nickserv identify <pass>
  -- added passfail count to IRC connections to prevent bruteforce logins

[WAR3]: 
  -- droped <1.13 support, added 1.15 support (CG,PG,AT, clan profile view)

[LADDERS]:
  -- added .dat/.xml ladder output for STAR/SEXP/W2BN rating based ladder
  -- moved textual ladder files from ladderdir to statusdir

[PREFS]
  -- fixed handling of comments (previously it skipped the whole line no 
  matter where '#' was)

[MISC]:
  -- updated autoupdate with latest clients versions
  -- fixed "message_cache_lookup: unsupported connection class" errors when 
  broadcasting message (ex /ann) and having any connection different than 
  irc/telnet/bot/bnet (ex d2cs etc)
  -- added client, version and country info to the /finger command
  -- added clan and clan rank info to the /finger command
  -- added option to bnmotd.txt to display info about new mail
  -- adjusted /whois command to be more like on battle.net
  -- massivly renamed configuration files so each has an extension
  -- added scripts/pvpgn_hash.inc.php so everyone who needs has a php-
     implementation of the commonly used passhash algorithm
  -- fixed problem with topaz-chat (and maybe other clients, too)
     not propperly displaying tmpOP on initial channel join
  -- adjusted friends/watch game/server join/leave message to be more like b.net
     (changed message type from info to whisper)

a general 1.6.x note:
versioncheck exe-time parsing now REALLY works as it was intended to.
So ALL users using fucked up no-CD cracks or strange war3.org's may
fail to login due to wrong file-time. That's not our problem.

ChangeLog for 1.6.0beta (since 1.6.0pre5)
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Most of the files under "files" directory where moved in their own package now 
which is distributed separately. To setup a fresh server you will need to get 
the "files" package too and unpack it into "files" directory of your PvPGN 
installation.

-- fixed bug in d2cs where it didnt accepted new chars if lod_realm was set 
to any 0 or 1 value (but worked with 2 set by default)
-- now there are binary ladder files for all ladder types. This significantly
decreases server startup time when having many accounts. Those files are stored
in the ladderdir. If you want/need the ladder to be rebuild from accounts,
simply shutdown server, delete the corresponding binary ladder file(s) and 
startup server again. The /rank_all_accounts command has been removed.
-- added option for d2dbs to only add "ladder" chars to the ladder
-- fixed output of D2 XML ladder experience value (from signed to unsigned)
-- added missing d2 1.10 eMail registration request
-- rewritten the packet queue codes to reduce memory management calls and in 
turn reduce CPU usage
-- fixed Starcraft game list requests (sends game_type_all lately)
-- "fixed" the infamous "got error handling packet id 0x15ff" message when no 
ads configured
-- fixed userlist in Win32 GUI to update after each user login and not only for 
-- fixed LOTS of uninitilized data bytes sent to network I/O in d2cs
-- added ladder_start_time to d2cs.conf
-- location clean up of some WIN32 build files
-- fixed d2cs problems that newly created accounts can sometimes not create 
new chars until they go back to char selection screen and then try again to 
create a char
-- fixed problems with game reports on WIN32 (couse it doesnt like filenames 
starting with '.')
-- removed some useless log messages
-- removed the "static" motd part and included this stuff in conf/bnmotd.txt
-- added docs/bnmotd.txt that explains the usage
-- fixed startgame4 handling routine; game lists should be all OK now
-- fixed d2cs and d2dbs so they compile and work on WIN32 too and changed WIN32 
build files to compile them (d2closed will no longer be needed)
-- added the possibilty to add new lines to bnxpcalc.txt to increase the
WAR3/W3XP +/-6 level ladder-rule
-- rewritten the "specific" game search and reply (shouldnt allow clients to 
try to join non-open games)
-- added support for d2dbs and d2cs to run as a service on WIN32
-- removed option from configure for enabling BITS (totally broken)
-- cleaned private/passworded games related codes also fixing private games 
with newest W3 clients (they were considered public and listed)
-- fixed parsing mapinfo for W3 clients
-- "fixed" clanscdb dir by not giving it as example to cdb storage; at this 
moment clans in cdb mode are stored the same way as in plain files mode
-- completly removed BITS codes and other BITS related data
-- fixed problems with multiple news items for the same date (now those are
automagically merged) and the problem, that date displayed for some news
items was off by one day for each news after the first one
-- fixed an issue with new news items not showing up. This was caused by a wrong
timestamp in a news entry. The symphtom was, that after your first connect to 
any PvPGN server news items weren't updateing anymore, even when news.txt seemed
to have news that were more recent. Also ask your users to once delete their
bncache.dat or this fix won't help them.
-- fixed fdwatch select() backend broken a couple of releases ago :-/

1.6.0pre5 (since 1.6.0pre4):
-- added support for loading new accounts at runtime (ex. if made by some 
external webscript)
-- fixed a double free() bug in loading of clans in some corner cases
-- added d2 1.10 support codes (this makes pvpgn support only d2 1.10 
clients for the moment, compatiblity support will be added in next release)

1.6.0pre4 (since 1.6.0pre3):
-- fixed problem that started game remain in gamelist in war3/w3xp 1.13

don't generate anongame_infos data each time when user logon
-- tournament settings will also reload when get restart signal

them to src/win32/
-- fixed saving of SC/BW last game result with SQL storage
-- finished kqueue fdwatch backend and made it be chosed over poll/select
-- added new conf option userstep to configure the no. of users we check for 
updates each run (we dont check them all at once anymore because on servers 
with many accounts this takes too much time)
-- added binary ladder files for WAR3/W3XP (those should speedup server start,
especially on servers with many accounts)
-- now bans added via /kill, /killsession and /ipban get saved to banfile
properly, too (previously only /serverban's were saved)

Battle.net
-- server status file now also contains the server version (for external
programs that need to know what PvPGN version is running)

1.6.0pre3 (since 1.6.0pre2):
-- fixed clan crash bug (when any user with clans logged in on sql/cdb pvpgn 
would crash)
-- made race wins needed for channel/profile icons configurable via
anongame_infos.conf
-- made war3/w3xp profile screen xp-progress-bar work for levels above 23
-- adjusted war3/w3xp level calculation in case of xp loss to match with
battle.net (now you drop a level when you reach the startxp of the level
below, not when you drop below the startxp of the current level)
-- modified war3_ladder code to sort primary by level and secondary by xp
(thus making war3ladder behaing like battle.net ladder now)

dnd/away status) and immediatly showing correct
-- added promote/demote shortcut for friends
-- fixed mutual status for deleted friends

1.6.0pre2 (since 1.6.0pre1):
-- fixed searching for connection of a acccount uid (thus getting rid of all 
those useless eventlogs got NULL account in account_get_uid)
-- merged patch from Zzzzoom for protection against brute force attacks
-- fixed friends problem when accounts got deleted and they were referenced 
by some other accounts, those who referenced them got "unknown" friend for each 
deleted friend (resulting in a possible disc when viewing friends list)
-- fixed problem (only appearing with topaz chat so far) that user seems to join
a channel on first connect twice (meaning: join-leave-join)
-- fixed check for allowed War3 game ports (was 1025-32766 now is 1024-49151)
-- fixed a tiny problem in war3 login req (when login with non existant user)

converting to uid-based friends is done

files (a new storage driver)
-- fixed war3 points gained/lost
-- added some workarrounds which should fix any problems having NULL accounts
into storage (especially on SQL case where it didnt overwrite existent account 
like files do)

updated icons.bni
-- added 1.12 W3 ROC/FT versioncheck entries

-- fixed very nasty bug affecting win32 PVPGN admins only
-- fixed possible/rare crash when doing /realmann while not beeing into any
realm
-- more anongame code cleanup

-- added PG 2v2v2 game type (three teams with two players on each team)

that have allready been deleted from the server earlier
-- fixed problems with SC stats being lost on server shutdown in mySQL mode
(caused due to unwanted renaming of the columns on next server startup)
-- added IRC style channel topics that get shown on channel join (with /topic
command)
-- speedup of versioncheck parsing (note: it seems like comparing file time
wasn't working as it should before, so u might now need to increase
version_exeinfo_maxdiff a bit [for me I had 3601 secs diff but 3600 allowed)
-- added new boot script for pvpgn (BSD style)
-- optimized friends handling code (this also changes the method how friends
are stored into storage; pvpgn will automagically convert from old format to
new format but once you run this pvpgn version you will have trouble to use
older versions)
-- redesigned and rewritten main loop and server.c; also introduced a new 
general API for watching socket status (fdwatch); the new code should be 
many times faster (especially when having a lot of concurrent connections)
-- fixed the 99% CPU usage while it shutdown phase
-- optimized unnecesary often update of "now" timestamp inside server main loop 
using POSIX timers (where available)
-- changed the db_creator, it now uses a config file (conf/sql_DB_layout) and 
creates missing tables and columns if needed. (can add columns to an allready
existant table). Also can add the default user (uid==0) when it was deleted
-- updated documentation

Warcraft III RoC and Frozen Throne
-- restructured autoupdate file to select correct mpq file base on version tag

client matching

the "bug" of not having the full version on tracker listings)

for our French players
-- added option in bnetd.conf to set number of friends a user may have in
their friends list

note that this BRAKES PlayGame for ROC < 1.07 (ie. 1.06, 1.05 et...)
-- fixed account saving problems in sql mode (mostly noted by having LOTS
of NULL username accounts), this fix wont produce those NULL usernames anymore
but you need to "clean" your DB of the old NULL usernames
(ex. DELETE FROM BNET WHERE acct_username is NULL)
-- added correct 1.07 ROC/FT versionchecks
-- fixed project files for VC++ , it should compile ok now

1.5.0beta:
note:
   this is a BETA version. It contains LOTS of changes and new code. It needs
 LOTS of testings. But because of public request we released a first PVPGN
 version supporting WAR 3 FT/ROC 1.10. There are KNOWN bugs related to 
 PG with ROC mode of Frozen Throne.

operators/admins

chatting should be fine.
When u wanna just update the executable, please make sure, to update the versioncheck

1.2.4 aka 1.3.0:
-- irc: prevented "unknown command"-flooding by adding ignors for lagtime and ISON

front of it anymore

removed last compiler warnings from win32-release

server crash on previous version

get loaded via account_reload() (so u can add accounts manually which will get
added to the running server) (optional via bnetd.conf)
-- based on the account_reload() and some modification of it a new command got
