  -- allow changing /nick before login
  -- allow another try on a wrong /msg nickserv identify <pass>

  structs

  -- adjusted /whois command to be more like on battle.net
  -- massivly renamed configuration files so each has an extension
  -- added scripts/pvpgn_hash.inc.php so everyone who needs has a php-
     implementation of the commonly used passhash algorithm

     not propperly displaying tmpOP on initial channel join
  -- adjusted friends/watch game/server join/leave message to be more like b.net

     (different shortname, same special name)

     integers for comparations instead of strings
  -- changed almost every place where sending username to send the logged in 
  username (if differs in case) than the account username (this fixes some bugs 
  like modifying some account data when logged in with different case and also 
  gets us to closer Battle.net behaivour)
