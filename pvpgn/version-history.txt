PvPGN Version History:

1.4.0:
-- fixes for PG/AT and late War3 versions
-- fixed many mySQL issues (attributes not being saved in previous version)
-- added compability for Borland C compiler
-- here we go... added basic "W3 The Frozen Throne" support. So far, we only
have Custom Game working, but that should be a good point to start from...
So no PG/AT yet, new clan feature not yet implemented... And we are quiet sure,
there are still enough leaks left to crash the server... but plain CG playing and
chatting should be fine.
When u wanna just update the executable, please make sure, to update the versioncheck 
file, too.

1.2.4 aka 1.3.0:
-- irc: prevented "unknown command"-flooding by adding ignors for lagtime and ISON
-- irc: changed motd from old huge bnetd logo to smaller message
-- bnetd-commnds can be typed as in battle.net without need for the /BNET in 
front of it anymore
-- passing all unkown commands from irc to bnet-command-interpreter now
-- winmain.c : new handler for admin-console, fixed/optimized some main code, 
removed last compiler warnings from win32-release
-- fixed a tiny bug in anongame.c causing the recently added timer not to close 
a players game-connection but his connection to the server
-- fixed some error in war3ladder causing ladder not to be updated
-- better handling of "broken" atteams in war3ladder - could have caused
server crash on previous version
-- new bnetd.conf option: added boolean option XML_output_ladder for supporting
jfro's latest ladder
-- added command line option -x and --XML to run bntrackd in XML output mode
and added a nice servers.xsl from jfro to show server list based on XML files
-- added XML_output_ladder option to d2dbs.conf for additional output of D2
ladder to xml file - once again... for ladder pages
-- added support for closed realms (d2cs) behind a router
-- added command line option (-p PORT) to bnpcap to specify port number
to process. Defaults to 6112
--- updated fsgs2bnetd.pl script - Thanks Keto
-- added account_allowed_symbols configuration variable to bnetd.conf and
d2cs.conf. Now you have full control of the symbols allowed in account names.
But please read the warnings in the conf files carefully - you have been
warned. ALWAYS keep both variables at the same value!!!
This fix solves the problem with accounts not beeing able to play D2 closed
games, cause bnetd and d2cs were accepting different symbols.
-- fixed /time command
-- added war3 ladder info output to /ladderinfo command
thanks for the following changes go to [KWS]
-- added /ping command which returns your server latency
-- added support for W2BNE TOPVBOT game-type
-- added new options to makefile called bnetd and install-bnetd (now u can
just compile the server and install new server executable)
-- replaced gmtime() with localtime() here and there
-- on a /rehash and after each account_save() new created accounts 
get loaded via account_reload() (so u can add accounts manually which will get
added to the running server) (optional via bnetd.conf)
-- based on the account_reload() and some modification of it a new command got
added called /reload_accounts_all which will reload account data for all users
currently not logged in (and remove all accounts where userfile/db entries
got removed) and /reload_accounts_new which will only load new created
accounts
-- modified /set command to return current value if no value to set is given
-- massivly cleaned up command.c and updated bnhelp so that /help command
should be somehow up-to-date now
-- some ad banner sending order fixes
-- updated versioncheck and matchmaking file
-- /watch and /watchall command should work now
-- rewritten command.c from the huge case/switch style to nice function
handlers
-- added command groups for more admin control. Be sure to read the config
file command_groups.txt for more info. bnetd.conf & bnetd_default_user
were modified. Make sure to note changes. 
-- fixed a little bug concerning MySQL. now Diablo II clients should display
lastlogin_time correct. (this was a general problem for ALL attributes that
contained a '_')
-- make clan show up on war3 profile screen
-- speed up mySQL mode. it now only requests single attributes from the DB
and doesn't load them all for a given account at once
-- changed warcraft3 XP calculation to work the same as on battle.net
(make sure you install new bnxpcalc.txt when updating)

1.2.3:
-- fixed some crash related bugs
-- rewritten handle_bnet.c from 5000 lines case/switch style to a table of
function handlers (should be more readable)
-- fixed a old bnetd bug in give_up_privileges.c
-- misc code cleaning (compiler warnings, unused variables)
-- changed reduced_accounting conf option from int to bool type

Diablo II open join game dialog
-- fixed bug where D2 clients would not get accutate friend list info
-- added a realtime ladder for War3 supporting seperate ladders for solo,team,ffa
and at games (keeping top 1000 accounts)
-- output of War3 ladder into 4 seperate text files in /var/ladders that can
be easily parsed to create nice ladder pages for the web (output interval can
be configured via bnetd.conf)
-- some optimizations for MySQL mode - only changed attributes are flushed to
DB now
-- fixed 3 tiny memory leaks (files not beeing closed after opening them)
-- added option to reduce the size of accounts by not keeping firstlogin infos
in the account and removing unused lastlogin infos (experimental - if your
client seems to miss some info now, plz report as a bug). This can be done via
a new parameter in bnetd.conf and the new command /remove_accounting_infos
-- added /rehash command to reload bnetd.conf

1.1.7 RC1:
