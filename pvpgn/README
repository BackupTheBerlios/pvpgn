             ---------------------------------------------

    PvPGN is a BNETD mod which aims to provide support for all Blizzard 
clients (thus it supports all BNETD supported clients plus the most recent 
ones).

    The documentation is located in the docs directory. Please read docs/INDEX 
for a list of files and what they contain.
    If you are updating from a previous PvPGN version check the file UPDATE 
first.
