Readme for Player vs. Player Gaming Network 1.1.6
-------------------------------------------------


Install instructions for the Linux version:

Without database support (accounts stored in user files):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

cd src
./configure
make
make install

With database support (accounts stored in mysql database):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(only use this if you have mysql installed and are somewhat familiar with it!)

cd src
./configure --with-mysql
make
make install

Remember to edit your bnetd.conf (installed in /usr/local/etc by default) to
setup your mysql host, username, password and socket (usually /tmp/mysql.sock).
