<p class="text">Need help using PvPGN?  Here are your options:</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2"><a href="http://pvpgndocs.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Documentation.</a></strong>  This is where you should start.  The documentation is currently under construction although constantly growing, and it is definately helpful.</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">pvpgn-users mailing list.</strong>  Get help from other users.  Sign up <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pvpgn-users" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">PvPGN Forums.</strong>  If you can't figure out your problem yourself (after reading through the documentation), then you should try the forums at <a href="http://forums.pvpgn.org" target="_blank">http://forums.pvpgn.org</a>.  Before posting for help, please search the forums to see if your question has already been answered as it is annoying for us to answer the same question over and over again.</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">PvPGN IRC.</strong>  Channel <strong>#pvpgn</strong> on <strong>irc.pvpgn.org</strong>.  You can chat with other PvPGN users and the developers there.</p>

<p class="helptitle">Giving help</p>
<p class="text">PvPGN is a volunteer effort.  Here's how <strong>you</strong> can help:</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">The pvpgn-devel mailing list.</strong>  Whether you're a potential developer, tester, or just want to know what's going on with PvPGN, anyone interested in PvPGN development should <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pvpgn-devel" target="_blank">join the pvpgn-devel mailing list</a>.  We will occasionally ask for new code to be tested and get your feedback, as well as discussing new features, bugs, new releases, etc.</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">Developers.</strong>  PvPGN has very few active developers and needs a lot more!  If you can code C, then the best way to give something back to the PvPGN community is to become a developer.  Start by reading the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/pvpgn/pvpgn/README.DEV?view=markup" target="_blank">README.DEV</a> document.</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">Testing.</strong>  PvPGN is always looking for good testers (see above)</p>
<p class="text"><strong class="text2">Documentation.</strong>  The project is always short on people willing to write documentation.</p>
